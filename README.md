# PROJECT-MBTA

INTRODUCTION:
The MBTA is the public transporation system in the city of Boston. Since 2006 the MBTA has used the MIFARE-CLASSIC T-Cards as the primary method of payment for using the T in the city of Boston. All trains, buses ect. use this payment system and continue to use it today. The city of Boston has neglected to update this system and properly fund the MBTA leading to a stagnation in the technology and infastructure of the MBTA. 
Nearly a million Bostonians ride the MBTA every week, and for those of lower economic status it may be there only form of transporation (as Boston is one of the most expensive cities to live in). The MBTA's lack of funding has caused trains and buses to be less frequent and predicatable, more likely to break down, and has caused multiple incidents where trains were shut down for weeks or months. According to healthaffairs.org "Lack of access to public transportation can disproportionately harm older people and people with disabilities. It can also contribute to existing racial and economic disparities by decreasing mobility and forcing individuals to depend on costly car ownership"(Heaps et al. paragraph 5). This project seeks to demonstrate this lack of care by showing how easily exploitable this system is, and the MBTA's dire need for greater techonlogical security.
